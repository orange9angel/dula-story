description: Create or revise production-ready Dula `script.story` episodes from a theme, premise, or research brief. Use when an agent needs to research current or canonical context on the internet, design a funny or meaningful short story, write character dialogue and visual beats, map them to registered Dula scenes/actions/cameras, and validate the result before the existing audio and render skills run.

# Story Writer

Write the story layer for this repository. Use the current agent for research, reasoning, and prose; do not call a second LLM API. Keep the skill in `.agents/skills/story-writer/` and write episode output under `dula-story/episodes/`.

## Boundaries

- Produce or revise `script.story`. For a brand-new episode, also create the minimal `bootstrap.js` needed to call `registerAll()` when it is absent.
- Do not create or overwrite `voice_config.json`, ambient configuration, music, SFX, generated audio, screenshots, or video unless the user separately asks for that work.
- Preserve an existing `script.story` unless the user clearly requested an edit or rewrite. When replacement authority is ambiguous, write `script.story.draft` and report it.
- Treat `dula-engine/lib/StoryParser.js` and actual registry calls in `dula-assets/index.js` plus the target episode as the contract. Do not invent actions, scenes, cameras, transitions, or props.
- Treat `doraemon_stone_hat` as a production reference, not a syntax authority. It contains legacy unregistered animation names and a bad position value.

## Load Context

Read only the references needed for the task:

- Read [references/story-format.md](references/story-format.md) before authoring or changing `.story` syntax.
- Read [references/writing-quality.md](references/writing-quality.md) before outlining, writing comedy, adapting research, or running the critic pass.

Discover the current engine vocabulary instead of copying a stale list:

```shell
python .agents/skills/story-writer/scripts/story_tool.py catalog --episode-dir dula-story/episodes/<episode>
```

The catalog includes official registrations, animation source groups, reachable registrations found from the target bootstrap, supported props, audio registry names, local audio stems, and procedural SFX types. Prefer `common` animations or the speaking character's own group; global registration alone does not guarantee a good pose on every character. If a requested asset is absent, choose a registered alternative or implement/register the asset only when the user asked for engine or episode code changes.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the brief.** Extract theme, audience, tone, target duration, cast, episode directory, and whether the request is a new story or a rewrite. Infer noncritical omissions from repository context. Default to a concise 60-120 second episode when duration is not specified.
2. **Inspect the target.** Read its existing `script.story`, `bootstrap.js`, relevant config keys, and nearby episode conventions. Run `catalog` before selecting visual tags.
3. **Research when useful.** Use available web search/fetch tools when the user requests internet research, facts may be current, or canon/cultural context affects the premise. Prefer primary or authoritative sources. Record a compact fact list and source URLs in working context; do not paste citations into dialogue. If web tools are unavailable, say so and avoid invented facts.
4. **Build story candidates.** Form at least two compact beat approaches with different comic or thematic engines. Select the stronger one using the rubric in `writing-quality.md`; do not merely combine both.
5. **Outline causally.** Define protagonist want, obstacle, escalating attempts, irreversible turn, payoff, and optional emotional aftertaste. Every beat must cause the next. Plant any callback before paying it off.
6. **Draft for performance.** Give each speaker a distinct objective and rhythm. Prefer playable subtext, interruption, reaction, and visual action over explanation. Keep one speaking character per entry.
7. **Map to Dula.** Use only cataloged assets. Establish a scene before dialogue, keep positions stable unless movement is intentional, use safe camera distances, and allocate dialogue time from estimated speech rather than fixed-size slots.
8. **Validate and revise.** Run the strict validator, fix every error, then perform one critic pass for premise, causality, character voice, humor/meaning, visual storytelling, and ending. Rewrite weak beats rather than polishing isolated words.
9. **Hand off cleanly.** Report the story path, research sources when used, validator result, and any remaining audio/render work. Do not claim render readiness until the engine verification stages have run.

## Strict Validation

Run this after every material draft change:

```shell
python .agents/skills/story-writer/scripts/story_tool.py validate --story dula-story/episodes/<episode>/script.story --episode-dir dula-story/episodes/<episode>
```

Use explicit allow flags only for real runtime assets that the static scanner cannot see:

```shell
python .agents/skills/story-writer/scripts/story_tool.py validate --story <path> --episode-dir <dir> --allow-character CustomHero --allow-animation CustomPose --allow-prop CustomProp --allow-music planned_theme
```

After a complete episode has bootstrap and dependencies, run the repository gates from `dula-story`:

```shell
node --check ./episodes/<episode>/bootstrap.js
npx dula-inspect-team ./episodes/<episode>
```

After audio exists, run `npx dula-verify ./episodes/<episode>` and visually inspect the generated shots. Unknown animations may be skipped at runtime, so a successful render never replaces strict registry validation.

## Minimal Bootstrap

For a new episode using only official assets, create this only when `bootstrap.js` is absent:

```javascript
import { registerAll } from 'dula-assets';

registerAll();
```

Use `RoomScene`, not an episode-local alias such as `NobitaRoom`, unless that alias is actually registered in the target bootstrap.
